# Titanic-Machine-Learning
This repository contains the dataset and Python code to train the model and to test the results. It involves NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit Learn for preprocessing, and Tensorflow for training the model. 

# Credits
I have referenced work from [this Python Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/linxinzhe/tensorflow-deep-learning-to-solve-titanic) and used data provided by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).
